# Purpose and scope
The main purpose of the site is to simplify the work of employees with financial accounting of the organization in different departments. The project is created to help people with business. Using the website, they can enter financial statements correctly, quickly, conveniently and easily. They will know how money is made and how it is spent, also who spends it and for what needs. So the user will spend less time on calculations and will have more time on other important things.

# Problem Statement
For people who are just starting their own businesses, it can be difficult and even incomprehensible to conduct financial calculations. And accordingly, it can be difficult for them to learn how to quickly and efficiently make calculations.

# Problem Solution
Our site helps a person to enter all information about income (from the date, ending with where the money came from). After entering all these data, the site automatically calculates and adds your money to the existing account. There is also a button for expenses, which also makes it possible to enter the amount spent (together with the purpose of expenses, date and other details) after which the site counts and subtracts a certain amount from the money in the account. And there is also an account-to-account transfer function, which makes it possible to transfer money from one bank account to another, which is very convenient for the user.
